== Uplug - NLP tools for processing (parallel) corpora ==

Uplug is a collection of tools and scripts for processing text-corpora. Its main focus is the creation of (annotated) parallel corpora. The toolbox is divided into several packages:

The new project home page: https://bitbucket.org/tiedemann/uplug

The old pages at SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/uplug/


=== Packages ===

**uplug-main**: main components and scripts

**uplug-xx**: language-specific tools and models (**xx** = language ID)

**uplug-treetagger**: integration of the TreeTagger

**uplug-webalign**: webinterface for interactive alignment (ICA, ISA)

**uplug-cwb**: tools for indexing parallel corpora for the CWB


=== Reference ===

Please cite the following dissertation if you use Uplug:

 }
}}}

=== Installation ===

Start by downloading the latest uplug-main tar-ball and install the main components. This is fully functional and includes already a lot of the main features and some annotation tools.


{{{
 tar xzf uplug-main*.tar.gz
 cd uplug-main*
 perl Makefile.PL
 make all
 sudo make install
}}}
You may then select the language packs that you'd like to include and install them one by one. Look at the documentation and readme's inside of those packages.

You may also download the latest source from bitbucket and install all packages in one run:


{{{
 git clone https://bitbucket.org/tiedemann/uplug.git
 cd uplug
 make all
 sudo make install
}}}
More about installation and usage: Read the documentation and look at the provided files: INSTALL, QUICKSTART & HOWTO
